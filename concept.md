# From Scratch
- Beginning with a store-bought crust and premade filling, start baking pies with your grandma's phone help, adding more and more complexity
- Different tabs have different variables to manage
  - Kitchen performs the assembly of ingredients; "Let' get baking!"
  - Sunroom is where crust, dough, jellies, and jams are made; "Let's get prepped!"
  - Garden is where fruits and vegetables are grown; "Let's get planting!"
  - Mill is where sugar, corn, wheat, and spices are ground; "Let's get grinding!"
  - Barn is where cows are bred and raised; "Let's get tending!"
- All actions are performed by Decks
